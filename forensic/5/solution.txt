I want it to open the zip file but it was protected by password

so you will need to  bruteforce and the pass is : msspctf

after that  unzip it.

second thing you will need to do use exiftool and foremost to extract the image data and i found second image

so if you try steghide you need the input the password so you need to bruteforce it two

so you need to  bruteforce steghide using stegidebruteforce and you will found a hidden file and finaly you will get the flag


msspctf{H1dd1ng_1s_4lw4y5_4_b4d_1d34}
