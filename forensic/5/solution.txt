I want it to open the zip file but it was protected by password

so i bruteforce and i found the pass : msspctf

after that i unzip it.

second thing i did i used exiftool and foremost to extract the image data and i found second image

once i didn't find any thing in this second image i was thinking about steganography

so i bruteforce steghide using stegidebruteforce and I found a hidden file and finaly I get the flag


msspctf{H1dd1ng_1s_4lw4y5_4_b4d_1d34}
