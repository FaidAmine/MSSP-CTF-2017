here in this challenge we have three stages

the first one it check if the input is integer and the length more than 3 and the value is smaller than 2234

the number is : 1e4 ( you can execute this in python float(1e4) > 2234 ) 

the second and the third stages is easy you can bypass the filters with array []

the final url  is : 

http://web.msspctf.info/web4/?pass1=1e4&pass2[]=&pass3[]=

Finaly we get the flag in base64

i decode it but unfortunately the flag was again ecrypted using xor between the flag and a hmac hash.

I create a script to decode the flag : web4.py
